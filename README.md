# Assignment-2

I created a datastructure for graph using matrix. 1 indicates there is a train from one city to another city. 0 indicated there is no train. 
By using breadth first search I traveresed the route by picking the first possible train.
If the node is already visited we can ignore the placed and continue the search.
Once all 6 cities visited we can end the BFS there and exit.
